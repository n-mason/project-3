## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to change the flask_vocab anagram game so that the orignianl form interaction is replaced with AJAX interaction instead. The page will check each key that is pressed, and send the appropriate response based on the following conditions:
* If the letter(s)/word entered are not in the vocabulary, a message will be displayed at the bottom of the page
* If the word cannot be made from the letters in the anagram, a different message will be displayed at the bottom of the page
* If the word entered is a match, then it will be listed under "You found" (the words found are listed above the other messages mentioned above)
